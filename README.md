# CSE641-Deep-Learning

ðŸ“˜ **Course Overview:** <br>
This repository contains my coursework (assignments, &amp; semester exams) for the [Deep Learning](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=ECE553) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2025. <br>
The course covers foundational to advanced topics including MLPs, CNNs, Autoencoders (vanilla & variational), GANs, RNNs (LSTM), Attention & Transformers, model interpretability (saliency/sensitivity maps), auto-regressive models, and model compression techniques.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder Structure:**
- `/Assignment 1`: Implemented MLPs and CNNs (with custom Inception blocks) for Fashion MNIST and Speech Commands classification.
- `/Assignment 2`: Built Autoencoders, VAEs, and CVAEs for latent space modeling on Fashion MNIST.
- `/Assignment 3`: Designed and trained a conditional GAN to generate flower images based on textual descriptions.
- `/Assignment 4`: Predicted stock prices using LSTM-based time series modeling.
- `/Kaggle Competition 1`: Developed a regression model to minimize MSE on a structured dataset with three integer inputs.
- `/Kaggle Competition 2`: Build a DL model to decode EEG signals into intended speech and generate corresponding spectrograms. <i>Not Attempted</i>.
- `/Quizzes`: Contains materials related to the quizzes.
- `/Midsem`: Contains materials related to the midterm examination.
- `/Endsem`: Contains materials related to the endterm examination.

ðŸ“… **Semester:**
6th Semester (3rd Year)
